<!-- Additional Modules
This file is for adding custom modules to LUI.
To add a module to this file just include the following line between the <Ui> tags for each extra module:

<Script file="(module.lua)"/>

and replace (module.lua) with the file name

Note: this file must be renamed from extras.xml.txt to extras.xml in order to work.
	It is a good idea to make a copy of this file and rename it as such as to keep an original version.
