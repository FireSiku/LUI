<!-- Additional Modules
This file is for adding custom modules to LUI.
To add a module to this file just include the following line between the <Ui> tags for each extra module:

<Script file="(module.lua)"/>

and replace (module.lua) with the file name

Note: this file must be moved out of the modules folder, and next to lui.lua and lui.xml to work.
	It is a good idea to make a copy of this file and rename it as such as to keep an original version.
